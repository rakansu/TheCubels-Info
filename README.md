## Platform: IOS

## Project Status: Unpublished

## Project Description:

 This was my first project when I started learning programming for the very first time in 2016. The idea was inspired from a mini-game that I used to play on Playstaton 1. This project was a great learning experience because I acquired various skills and not only programming. The project was built completely from scratch. All the logic, code, 3D models, environment, VFX, textures, and UI were made by me.
 
 
 
## Game Objective: 
The goal of the game is paint the board with your color by walking on the squares. Then, you take the yellowish box to turn all your claimed squares into points. You compete against AI to see who gets to 120 points first. If you succeed, you go continue into the next round. The game gets difficult as you progress by making the AI becomes more competent and adding environmental challenges that hinder your progress.
